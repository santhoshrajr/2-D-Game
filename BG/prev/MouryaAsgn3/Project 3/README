Project no: 4
Project due date: 10/22/2015

Project description: Press T to track different objects in the animation. Made changes in classes Sprite, MultiSprite and World to move the responsibility for managing assets to frameFactory. Deleted all the memory leaks in frameFactory. 

Created a new class TwoWayMultiSprite which returns frames based on the direction of the object. 
 
Fixed MultiSprite::update. 

Capped FPS at around 60.
