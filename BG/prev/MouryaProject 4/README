Project description: 1)Created parallax scrolling using 4 different backgrounds and different factors for each background.

4) HUD which disappears after 2 seconds and can be toggled by pressing F1.



How you made your sprites:

background : http://munir99.deviantart.com/art/Angry-Birds-City-Background-295173534
sprite : http://www.gamefromscratch.com/image.axd?picture=jet_3.png

Game idea : The jet will be destroying the meteors using bullets. The jet has to destroy a certain amount meteors of in a given time or the player loses. If the meteors touch the jet, jet explodes and player loses the game.
